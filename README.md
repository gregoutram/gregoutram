# 👋

Hey, I'm Greg. Based in Yorkshire, I've been a self taught developer for about 16 years. Currently, I'm the Co-founder & Director of [Folifi](https://folifi.com), where I'm the lead engineer and work with companies of all sizes.

## Working on 👨‍💻

- [**Folifi**](https://folifi.com) ~ A Google Ads agency based in Leeds 🚀 
- [**Trade Hive**](https://trade-hive.com) ~ Website builder for trade businesses 🔨 

## Stack 🤓

It's quite varied - but lately I've been using NextJS, NuxtJS, Prismic, TailwindCSS and Vercel or AWS.

## Social 📝

I'm not as active as I should be on social media, but I'm starting to tweet some more. So if you fancy reading more about the joys of supporting Leeds United with the occassional bit of tech thrown in, give me a follow - [follow me](https://twitter.com/gregoutram/).
